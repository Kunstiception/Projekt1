  - You suck!
  - You are missing a button on your jacket!
  - You seem a little pale, buddy. Are you alright?
  - Out of my way, foul creature!
  - Why do all vampires wear the same clichee suit? You all have the same tailor?
  - What's your diet? Rats and squirrels?
  - Sorry, do you need an invitation to hit me? Being a vampire and all?
  - Your meek little fangs can't even pierce my armor!

  AnswersWhenHit:
  - How dare you?!
  - I must have lost it...
  - That must be the moonlight...
  - Alright alright...
  - S-So what?!
  - Sometimes they're all I can find..
  - A-Actually, yes...
  - My dentist told me to be careful!
  AnswersWhenResisted:
  - Yes and you are my next victim!
  - That's how you're SUPPOSED to wear it!
  - I'm just in need of a little... BLOOD!
  - Same to you!
  - You look like you could use some well-tailored garments yourself instead of that
    cheap tin you're wearing.
  - My taste is much more sopisthicated than that, I can assure you.
  - Oh, no. I can let myself in just fine.
  - That's fine, I can just sink them into your face instead.
