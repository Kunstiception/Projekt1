  Insults:
  - This is illegal!
  - Your cloak can't hide that ugly face!
  - You're about as stealthy as a court jester.
  - You really embody the stereotype of the smelly bandit.
  - How much do you make doing this? A coin a day?
  - Your pockets aren't big enough to carry all my riches.
  - Don't you miss sleeping in a proper bed?
  - Your dagger is so small, it might as well be a lockpick
