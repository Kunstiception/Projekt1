  - When I came into town I thought you were a statue...
  - 'Be honest, does anyone even take you seriously?  '
  - That chainmail must be heavy on your scrawny arms.
  - You're a glorified guard dog. Actually no, not even glorified.
  - Has this whole loyal guard thing ever actually worked for you?
  - Have you ever ACTUALLY caught anyone?
  - Didn't have it in you to become a real knight, did you?
  - Must be so hard sitting on your ass all day... "guarding" the town.
