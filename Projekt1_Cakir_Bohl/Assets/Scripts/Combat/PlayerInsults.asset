  - Your helmet has a dent!
  - Your blade is dull!
  - Your armor is rusty!
  - You seem a little... short for a fancy knight.
  - Don't you have any other weapons than that pathetic sword? A bow, a mace? Nothing?
  - Does your mom write your name inside of your helmet too, little knight?
  - Wait.. you're the "glorious knight" they were talking about? You?
  - You think you're so special, the cute little hero in your own fairytale?

  - Is it really? Why don't you come here and check?
  - Those are blood stains, my friend!
  - But tall enough to take your head!
  - I only pull those out for the worthy ones.
  - I bet you'd like a mom who loved you too, wouldn't you?
  - I know, I know. My reputation precedes me.
  - Matter of fact, I am.
