  - Believe it or not but I used to work at the gate you passed when you came in
    here.
  - A loyal and proud member of the "Order of Guards", to be exact.
  - Oh, how I hated it!
  - Standing around all day, not moving an inch... pure hell, I tell you!
  - But you learn about monsters, their strengths and weaknesses.
  - So I quit and here I am, much much happier.
