  Lines:
  - It was never my intention to release this potion into the wild.
  - But thanks to this little guy here, it happened anyway.
  - He escaped with one vial, which was enough.
  - It's highly potent and gets easily spread by the wind.
  - The avian fellow is the real genius to hallow.
  - He was the first I tried it on... well, the first one who survived.
  - I thought trying it on such an intelligent animal would be interesting.
  - But I hadn't perfected the formula yet - unlike the one of the vial he carried
    out the window.
  - And now he constantly talks in rhymes! It's infuriating!
  - The shallow mind can't comprehend the genius of my kind.
