  Lines:
  - More or less, there is.
  - You are in the first of seven valleys that are lined up, almost like pearls on
    a string, from west to east.
  - By the end of the last valley, you'll see a gigantic tree.
  - They call it the King's Crown.
  - I would strongly advise against going there, but it's a good landmark in case
    you are headed to the east.
  - Or where is it you want to go?
