  Lines:
  - We do... in a way.
  - It's where the voice-followers go, never to be seen again.
  - 'To put it simply: We are afraid the townsfolk will be next.'
  - Imagine people would just get up at night, walk there, guided by some mysterious
    voice - and then simply vanish.
  - Imagine the whole town deserted.
  - Gone to wherever they are taken.
  - That, dear knight, is why we speak the sermon and gift our offerings.
  - It has kept us safe ever since.
