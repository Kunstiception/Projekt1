  - "For weeks, even months now,\_you've had that same itch, a tingling sensation
    that makes your skin crawl."
  - There's something calling for you, waiting to be found.
  - You have no idea what it is, do you?
  - But maybe it's worth finding out.
  - "If anyone can do it, it's\_you."
  - You're strong. The strongest. The bravest and the best.
  - Wear your pride as a shield.
  - It'll always keep you safe.
  - Always.
